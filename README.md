# cmplx-journey

A journey with complex numbers.

## The question

> *Implement Heapsort and Quicksort on complex numbers, where < is defined as the L2 norm. Compare them according to
their asymptotic time-space, complexity and real-time complexity. Then compare the y-component and, finally, the
x-component.*

## Style Conventions

- Always `snake_case` for everything, except class names, for which we want `TitleCase`. Use descriptive names. They can
  be long. Use english to make it make sense.
    - An example of using English well: use `is_alive_and_well` for booleans, etc.
- Use `clangformat` to format the styles, please use `{ }` for every code block. Use `LLVM` Coding standards.
    - [LLVM Coding Standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)
    - `clang-format -style=llvm` do this.
- Add a header comment.
- Use `.hpp` files.
